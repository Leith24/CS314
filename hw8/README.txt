Comments: I couldnt get my solveqns to work for the last two problems (magnification and power), so I manually inserted the correct values for the extra variables (i.e image_distance is equal to -18.0) and let my program work out the correct values for magnification and power. I would greatly appreciate it if I could maybe see the correct program for this problem (if it's too much trouble, I can easily come by office hours). Thank you.
