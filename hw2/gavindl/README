Comments: I was unable to get binomial to work, but it doesn't have any errors preventing the running of the program. Everything else should be
	  correct.
Answers:
1. none
2. An invariant for peanoplus would be if y was negative. The method would keep calling itself, subtracting 1 from y to infinite as y would never reach 0. The big O is directly related to y, making it n.
3. The big O of peanotimes is also n*n as it calls on peanoplus(which has a big of n) n times depending on the y. The big O is n^2 (eek!).
4. none
5. none
6. none
7. none
8. The binomial coefficients for the pascal triangle are the same as the solutions to choose 4 k.
